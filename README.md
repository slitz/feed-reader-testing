# Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.  Jasmine, a behavior driven
Javascript test framework, is included to run tests against the application.

## How to run the application?

To run the RSS feeds application simply launch the index.html file in your favorite
web browser.

## How to interpret the test results?

A Jasmine test report appears at the bottom of the web page.  This will list the count
of tests (identified as 'specs') and the count of failures.  If any tests fail a
description will be displayed along with a stack trace.
